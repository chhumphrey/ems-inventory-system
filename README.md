## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or download the project files**
   ```bash
   cd ~/ems-inventory-system
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set environment variables (optional)**
   ```bash
   export SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key-here"
   export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///ems_inventory.db"
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the system**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Default admin credentials:
     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `admin123`

## Configuration

### Database
The system uses SQLite by default for simplicity. For production use, consider:
- PostgreSQL for better performance and concurrent access
- MySQL for enterprise environments
- Update the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable accordingly

### Security
- Change the default admin password immediately after first login
- Update the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable in production
- Consider implementing HTTPS for production deployments

### Colors and Branding
The system uses a fire/EMS color scheme:
- **Fire Engine Red**: #D32F2F (Primary actions, headers)
- **EMS Blue**: #1976D2 (Secondary actions, links)
- **Warning Yellow**: #FFC107 (Alerts, warnings)
- **Safety Green**: #4CAF50 (Success, good status)
- **Alert Red**: #F44336 (Danger, expired items)
- **Caution Orange**: #FF9800 (Warnings, expiring soon)

## Usage

### First Time Setup
1. Log in with the default admin account
2. Create additional user accounts for your team
3. Set up locations (ambulances, supply rooms, go bags)
4. Add inventory items with proper specifications
5. Perform your first inventory count

### Daily Operations
1. **Perform Inventory Counts**: Use the "New Count" feature to record current stock levels
2. **Monitor Reports**: Check the reports section for expired items, low stock, and expiring supplies
3. **Update Inventory**: Modify counts as supplies are used or restocked

### Administrative Tasks
1. **User Management**: Add/remove users and manage permissions
2. **Location Management**: Add new locations or modify existing ones
3. **Item Management**: Add new supplies or update specifications
4. **Data Restoration**: Restore accidentally deleted data (admin only)
